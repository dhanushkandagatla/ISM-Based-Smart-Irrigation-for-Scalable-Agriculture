# ISM Based Automatic Agriculture

Welcome to the "ISM Based Automatic Agriculture" project repository! This project represents an innovative, user-friendly approach to modernizing agriculture practices by simplifying the deployment of complex sensor networks in the field. Inspired by the concept of creating a system like Lego blocks, this project introduces a wireless, modular approach to agriculture automation, driven by cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, edge computing, and IoT (Internet of Things).

## Vision and Inspiration

Traditional agriculture practices often require farmers to manage complex arrays of sensors for monitoring various parameters like humidity, pH levels, and more. However, many farmers lack technical education and find it challenging to set up and maintain these systems. This project was born out of the vision to make advanced agriculture technology accessible to all farmers, regardless of their technical expertise. By integrating machine learning and deep learning techniques, we aim to empower farmers with data-driven insights, all while utilizing edge computing for real-time decision-making.

## Lego Block Concept 

The core concept of this project is to provide farmers with modular sensor units that resemble Lego blocks. Here's how it works:

* Farmers purchase modular sensor units from our outlet based on the specific parameters they need to monitor for their crops.

* Each modular sensor unit consists of two parts: a transmitter (placed in the field) and a receiver (inserted into a control unit).
* Control units have color-coded slots corresponding to the parameters being monitored. Farmers simply insert the receivers into the matching slots.
* The sensors in the field communicate with one another in a mesh network, ensuring robust data collection.
* Data is transmitted to the cloud via GSM modules present in the sensors.
